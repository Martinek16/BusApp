<h1 align="center"> BusApp -   bus transport  mobile app</h1>

BusApp is a mobile application intended for easy and faster search of information about bus services. Using the application, the user can easily find the appropriate station and the timetable for all routes of the selected station for every day of the year. The application offers different approaches to finding informations, such as interactive display of stations on the map, search with filtering and various functions that help in finding information.

The application was made for a final assignment. I made it for my hometown and surroundings, so the content is written in Slovenian.
